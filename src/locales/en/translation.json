In Vietnam, mangoes are grown from North to South, mostly concentrated from Binh Dinh southward, and especially in the Mekong Delta provinces such as Ben Tre, Tien Giang, Dong Thap, Vinh Long, and Can Tho. Vietnam ranks 13th in the world in mango production.",
    "mango_desc_2": "With many years of experience in exporting mangoes, Chanh Thu has been and will continue to bring mangoes to consumers around the world. Ripe mangoes have an attractive yellow color, a sweet and sour taste, and a characteristic aroma. Ripe mangoes contain nutrients such as glucid, protein, lipids, ash, water, and other minerals like calcium, phosphorus, iron, vitamin A, vitamin B1, vitamin C, folic acid, and beta-carotene.",
